## Background Information

The project instructions say to fork from the existing
ExData_Plotting1 repo, so I did that and then cloned that repo's
files to a new project in RStudio.
The instructions also say that the repo should contain a total
of 8 files - 4 .r files and 4 .png files.
Unfortunately, those instructions appear to be conflicing (or
at least confusing) because the repo and the project contain lots
of files.
Thus, I created a new project and a new repo from scratch, both
with the name week1ProjectRepo and used .gitignore to limit the
pushed files to the repo, so I could abide by the instructions.
